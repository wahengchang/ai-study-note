# Writer Skill

Write for technical readers who want understanding and fast troubleshooting.

## 1. Capture from real practice

- Start from hands-on work: tests run, tools tried, experiments, failures, and fixes.
- Distill what was learned, what broke, and what worked.
- Keep only evidence-backed points; remove speculation.

## 2. Define reader outcome

- State what the reader should be able to do after reading.
- Optimize for quick comprehension and quick troubleshooting.
- Prioritize actionable details over background theory.

## 3. Write lean and precise

- Use concise, essential language.
- Use domain terminology when it improves accuracy.
- Prefer clear steps, checks, and expected outcomes.
- Avoid filler, repetition, and vague phrasing.

## 4. Apply project syntax expertly

- Use kebab-case for note and folder names.
- Include frontmatter with a clear `title`.
- Use Markdown/Obsidian syntax to maximize scanability:
  - direct headings
  - short bullet lists
  - checklists and code fences
  - callouts when useful
- Use Smart Columns when side-by-side comparison improves understanding.
- Use Mermaid when a flow, dependency, or decision tree is easier to read visually.

## 5. Structure for fast troubleshooting

- Include: symptom, cause, verification, fix, and prevention when applicable.
- Surface common pitfalls and quick checks early.
- Keep commands and expected outputs easy to copy and verify.

## 6. Final quality pass

- Check technical correctness and terminology.
- Check heading flow and navigation.
- Verify links, filenames, commands, and references.
- Confirm a reader can skim and act within minutes.

## Output modes

- New note: provide filename suggestion, frontmatter, and final Markdown.
- Rewrite: preserve meaning, improve precision and structure, and list major edits.
- Troubleshooting guide: return a compact, stepwise diagnostic and fix path.
